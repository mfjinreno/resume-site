  <p class = "about-body">Im a West Coast native, but Im back east to pursue my degree in Computer Science at Ohio State. I was raised in a family that was constantly challenging me, which taught me that dinners should never be boring, and losing is how you learn. I have a love for all things flat, as you can probably tell, which drives most of my designs. Im a socially motivated person, with interests outside of the classroom, ranging from ballroom dance to model-building. Ive always been a fan of UI/UX, but as Ive begun delving further into data-management, Ive found myself enjoying my work more and more.</p>
